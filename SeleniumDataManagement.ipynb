We then reset the row indeces and add a column filled with the ticker name to differentiate the data once it's combined.

    "Next we actually need to go through the quarterly urls and and pull the data from the table. We begin as we have before by making an empty list in which to house the data and iterating through our url dataframe. We encounter a new hurdle to tackle, as if there are more than a small number of estimates, the table only shows the first few and then has a \"Show More\" button. When clicked, the table loads and displays more estimates plus another \"Show More\" button. To see all the estimates, you have to keep clicking the \"Show More\" button until they've all loaded. To navigate this setup, we need to first check for the prescence of the button (remember, if there are only a few estimates, the table loads in its entirety and does not include the \"Show More\" button). To do this, we use the try, except logic. First, we try to find the button by telling the web driver to search for the button element (denoted by its CSS selector), but importantly, we also use our WebDriverWait function to tell the driver to wait up to ten seconds while searching for the button element before moving to the next step. This wait allows the button to load. If the button is identified, we assign its location to the link_element object and then tell the driver to click it using the click() function. This search for the button and click if found repeats until the button is no longer found because all the data has been loaded. If the button isn't found, we print a message showing that the button wasn't found and then move on to the next step of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are certain our table has fully loaded, we again use a try, except logic to grab the table. It is important we do this, as the table does not necessarily have to exist on the page if there were no estimates made for the company in the specific quarter (in our dataset all the quarters did have estimates). In our try portion, we seek out the table using its CSS selector as we did in the previous scrape, pull its data, put it in a dataframe, and add Ticker, Quarter, and Year columns filled with the iterations' values to ensure we can differentiate the data. The finished dataframe is added to our empty list, and once we've iterated through all urls, we convert our list of dataframes into a single combined dataframe."

    "Next, we need to pull information from user profiles. We can't use the usernames that we've already collected, as the site allows users to create usernames that may or may not differ from the username that is used for their profile url. To start, we have to create a list of all users who made estimates in our previous individual estimate pull. We don't want to have duplicate users, so instead of a list, we make an empty set here. The first portion of our iteration is the same as above where we iterate over the quareterly data urls and search for and click the \"Show More\" button. This whole username set process could have been done with our first iteration, but we split it to a separate step to avoid making our code too complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the driver is at the url and has fully loaded the table, we again point to the full table. This time though, we identify the table as an html table and then use BeautifulSoup to parse it. After parsing it, we use BeautifulSoup to find all elements in the table that have the object attribute 'data-user' (the url usernames we're looking for) and put them in a list called user_elements. From that list, we pull just the username portion of the elements and put them in another list called user_values. Finally, these usernames are added to original empty set. By being added to a set, which does not house duplicate values, we effectively get a list of all unique usernames. As shown below, we also pring the updated count of usernames from our set so that we can monitor if our code is running properly as it processes."

    "We now have to pull data from the user profiles. In this version of the notebook, we pulled 1000 users, as it took ~two hours to process. While possible to pull all 9,000+ users found, we deemed the ~20 hours of computing needed to pull this data to be unnecessary for completion of the project (confirmed to be acceptable by the professor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have so many users to iterate through, we need to pull all of our user data in one large iteration chunk. This setup isn't ideal, as it leads to a very complicated iteration setup, but we felt it was necessary to set the code up in this way for maximum computing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to pull general user data. We follow a familiar pattern of making an empty list and then iterating through user ursl. At the url, we tell the driver to select several different elements using the CSS selector and then we convert the values found at the locations to text and assign them to objects. These objects are added to a dictionary that contains all the general user data and then the data is added to our empty list. The one complicated value for the general data is Roles. Users can have one, two, or three roles which complicates our driver element selector process. If we just created a code to look at the selectors for the three roles, users that have fewer than three or two roles would raise an exception at the extra element selectors. To get around this issue, we make a list of the role selectors and an empty list for roles. For each user, we iterate over the three selectors in order, try to find them using the driver, and assign the found value to our empty role list if one is found. If the selector is not found (for instance if a user only has one role, and we are now checking the second selector in the iteration) the code raises an exception and responds to the exception by passing. This setup returns a list of roles for each person that is assigned along with the other general user data in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to pull data from each of three data tables at the bottom of the page. The issue with these tables is that they do not load until they are present on screen. Additionally, they have hidden rows and a \"Show More\" button that don't appear until the bottom row of the currently loaded data set is visible on screen. This behavior continues until all of the hidden rows have been loaded.  To get around this issue, we first have to apply a bit of logic. We want the driver to scroll down to where the first table (Stocks Covered) is when it first loops through the code. Once it's loaded and visible, we want it to look at the html code of the table in question for if there are hidden rows still present in the table. If there are hidden rows, we want the driver to scroll down again so that more data will load and the \"Show More\" button will become available. We want to repeat this process until all data is loaded. To apply the first part of the scroll logic, we created an object called first_attempt and set its value equal to True before beginning the iterations. Next, in the iterator after pulling all of the general user data, we tell our driver that if first_attempt is True (which it always is at the beginning of the iteration due to its value being set outside of the iteration), the driver should scroll down a set distance (found by trial and error) that will show the table, allowing it to load. We then set first_attempt to false and restart our if loop. Now that first_attempt is not True, we continue to the next part of our code. In this set of code, we first scroll down again to load more data that may be hidden and reveal a \"Show More\" button if there is more data to be loaded. If there is more data to be loaded, the table will have rows labeled as 'linked-row-hidden' it its html format. We tell our code to select the full table in its current state, parse it using BeautifulSoup, search for the presence of the hidden rows. If hidden rows are present, we tell the code to click the \"Show More\" button that should be present and visible on our screen due to the scrolling done at the beginning of the While loop and then restart the While loop to continue the scrolling and searching for hidden rows. Once there are no more hidden rows, the While loop breaks and we continue on to the next part of the code. Also of note, the users do not necessarily have to have this table on their profile, so if the selector returns an exception, we print that there was an issue pulling the Stocks Covered data for the specific username and then allow the code to continue on. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in our code, we have the Stocks Covered table selected and parsed using BeautifulSoup with the table assigned to an object called 'soup.' Unfortunately, we ran into issues with having our html parsing modules properly understand this object, so we created a workaround. This workaround changes the soup object to string type and splits it line-by-line. We then reviewed the output of this string and found a specific snippet of string ('profile-tbl-ticker') that identified the row where the ticker value is housed. From there, we figured out that the other values we wanted to pull were a consistent number of lines after the ticker line. To pull the data we want, we iterate over the soup string object searching for our ticker line identifier and pull values found in specific line counts after each line with that ticker line identifier string present. We then place the pulled values into a dictionary, convert the dictionary to a datframe, and then add the dataframe to our list of dataframes. We repeat this strategy to pull the data from the other two tables present on the page, but we remove the first_attempt logic. Launching straight into our While logic allows the driver to scroll down far enough to iniate the table's loading process."
